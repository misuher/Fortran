The file bitmap.F90 is my very first program, the code is really bad structured but as I said it was the first code.
It is a command line tool where you can select a bmp image from your computer, you can apply 6 different filters and of course save the result in a new file.

The other files are just little examples I wrote parallel to my learning of fortran.
